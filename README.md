ATMEGA328P Control of Virtual Tank using ARDUINO UNO

This project involves programming an ATMEGA328P processor on an Arduino Uno to control the operation of a virtual tank. 
The project uses an LCD for display, a keypad for input, and an EEPROM for data storage. 
The tank's valves, stirrer, and cooler are controlled based on the desired volume and temperature set by the user.
