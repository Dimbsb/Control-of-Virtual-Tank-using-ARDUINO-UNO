ATMEGA328P Control of Virtual Tank using ARDUINO UNO

This project involves programming an ATMEGA328P processor on an Arduino Uno to control the operation of a virtual tank. 
The system uses an LCD to display messages, a keypad for user input, an EEPROM for data storage, and employs serial communication for debugging and monitoring purposes. 
Users can input a desired liquid volume, which is then displayed on the LCD and saved to the EEPROM. 
The system controls the tank's inlet and outlet valves to achieve the desired volume, then activates a stirrer and cooler to reach a target temperature. 
Serial communication is used throughout the process to provide real-time feedback and facilitate debugging, ensuring the smooth operation of the tank management system.
The project is tested by running the generated hex file in PICSimLab, a virtual laboratory for microcontroller simulations, to ensure proper functionality and performance of the control system.

This project was developed as part of coursework at University Of Western Macedonia, demonstrating practical applications of microcontroller programming and system integration.
